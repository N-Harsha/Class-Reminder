# TimeTableProject
This is a Class reminder application which can remind us of the class if any class is active we just have to add the out time table in appropriate format that would ensure the program is running as intended. So, Be mindful when trying to insert your own timetable.

Gui_model.py script is used to make the front end part of the program.
new_timetable.py is the new version of timetable.py which helps in the detemining which class is at that perticular instant.
classnotifier.py is another version of class reminder which is much more effective in a way which could be used. This is made by using the ToastNotifier package if you want to use this program make sure you install this package first.
the bat files and the vbs files are used to run the program without the help cmd.
